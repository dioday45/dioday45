## Hey, there 👋 

My name is Jeremy Di Dio and I am currently pursuing a master degree in Data Science at EPFL.

Here are some projects I worked on:

- **[Real-Time Emotion Recognition in VR](https://github.com/dioday45/Emotion-recognition-evaluation-visualization)** 

  In this semester project done at the Immersive Interactive Group at EPFL. The goal of this project was to implement a machine learning model able to detect in real-time the emotions (Anger, Happiness, Disgust, Sadness, Fear and Surprise) from a particular type of data provided by a new facial tracker used in virtual reality environment. This [Streamlit app](https://share.streamlit.io/dioday45/emotion-recognition-evaluation-visualization/main) present the evaluation part of the implemented models.

  Here is the final [report](https://github.com/dioday45/Emotion-recognition-evaluation-visualization/blob/main/report_final.pdf) of this project.
