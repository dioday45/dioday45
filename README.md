# Hey, there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Jeremy Di Dio and I am currently pursuing a master degree in Data Science at EPFL.

Here are some projects I worked on:

- **[Real-Time Emotion Recognition in VR](https://github.com/dioday45/Emotion-recognition-evaluation-visualization)** 

  In this semester project done at the Immersive Interactive Group at EPFL. The goal was to implement a machine learning model able to detect in real-time the emotions (Anger, Happiness, Disgust, Sadness, Fear and Surprise) from a particular type of data provided by a new facial tracker used in virtual reality environment. This [Streamlit app](https://share.streamlit.io/dioday45/emotion-recognition-evaluation-visualization/main) present the evaluation part of the implemented models.

  Here is the final [report](https://github.com/dioday45/Emotion-recognition-evaluation-visualization/blob/main/report_final.pdf) of this project.

- **[QAM modulation for complex AWGN communication](https://github.com/dioday45/PDC-2022)**

  Course project for COM-302 (Principles of Digital Communication). Done in group of 4, the goal of this project was to use QAM modulation and demodulation to correctly communicate through a complex AWGN channel.
