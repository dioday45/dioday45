### Hey, there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Jeremy Di Dio and I am currently pursuing a master degree in Data Science at EPFL.

Here are some projects I worked on:

- [Real-Time Emotion Recognition in VR]: https://github.com/dioday45/Emotion-recognition-evaluation-visualization

  In this semester project done at the Immersive Interactive Group at EPFL. The goal was to use the features provided by a new facial tracker device in a virtual reality environment, to provide a real-time perception of the subject emotions (Anger, Happiness, Disgust, Sadness, Fear and Surprise).

  Here is the final [report](https://github.com/dioday45/Emotion-recognition-evaluation-visualization/blob/main/report_final.pdf) of this project.
